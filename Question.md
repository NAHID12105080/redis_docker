## Q1. How without providing any connection string node-typescript project was able to connect with redis (inside docker)?

When you run Redis in Docker on your local machine with default settings, it can connect automatically due to a few factors. Here’s why this works:

## 1. Default Host and Port

- Redis client libraries (including Node.js clients) often default to connecting to `localhost:6379` if no other connection details are provided.
- Running Redis with Docker using `-p 6379(local_machine_port):6379(docker_port)` exposes it on `localhost` at port `6379`, which matches the client’s default settings.

## 2. Docker Port Binding

- The command `-p 6379:6379` binds Redis in the container to port `6379` on your local machine.
- This makes Redis accessible on `localhost:6379`, as if it were running directly on your machine without Docker.

## 3. No Authentication by Default

- By default, Redis does not require authentication unless explicitly configured.
- This allows your code to connect without needing additional credentials.

# Explicitly Setting a Connection String

For production environments, remote Redis instances, or custom configurations, setting a specific connection string is recommended. Here’s an example using Node.js:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "redis";

const redisClient = createClient({
  url: "redis://localhost:6379",
});

redisClient.connect().catch(console.error);
```
